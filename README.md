### üìï About Me  

I am Mi3V, a Technical-Computer-Science student from the Czech Republic. I have been studying computer science since I was 4 years old (~2008/09).

I am a Linux / Cyber Security enthousiast and enjoy impulsively buying hardware, such as consoles, notebooks, phones, tablets etc.., if they're broken I can repair and reuse (them). I like searching for the limitations of Hardware and Software, and if possible, solve those.  I also like OP-SRC SW (Open-Source-Software) like Linux for example :D .

I am also Red-Grey hat H@ck3r, profesional at Cybersecurity.
